# DOIs for eScholarship Repository Content

The University of California's institutional repository is known as eScholarship. The platform is developed by the PAD team at CDL. The name "eScholarship" can also refer to the PAD team's journal and preprint publishing program, which uses some of the same technology but also differs in fundamental ways from the repository. 

Users from across UC frequently contact EZID for information about obtaining a DOI for content they have deposited or are planning to deposit in the eScholarship repository. Currently, the repository platform is not configured to assign DOIs automatically as part of any deposition workflows. The PAD team may support this in the future but this will depend on how the platform development work evolves and on competing priorities. 

Therefore, in the meantime, EZID can support a workaround in some cases to enable DOIs to be registered for eScholarship repository content. In all cases, the DOIs will be registered with DataCite and not Crossref. 

The requirements for implementing this workaround are similar to the general requirements for EZID accounts: the user must be from UC, must be planning to register more than one DOI, and someone (i.e., a unit lead or department head) must be able to take responsibility for long-term maintenance of the identifiers.

Users wishing to take advantage of this workaround also go through the same account request process as for other cases, meaning they need to consult with the campus contact and fill out the [EZID request form](https://tinyurl.com/ezid-request). The account setup process is the same as for other accounts (see [Reviewing and processing new user accounts](https://github.com/CDLUC3/ezid-service/blob/master/reviewing-and-processing-new-user-accounts.md)). 

Once the account is configured with a DataCite shoulder, the user will need to go through the following steps in order to assign a DOI to their content:

- Upload content to eScholarship
- Register the DOI in EZID, including the eScholarship target URL in the DOI metadata
- Update the eScholarship item with the DOI information (ideally both the metadata and the PDF itself, in case they get separated).
