Despite advances in smoking cessation research and new pharmacotherapies for tobacco addiction, many people who want to quit are unable to do so.  Consequently, there is considerable interest in “harm reduction,” the possibility of reducing the harmful effects of continued tobacco use in persons who are unable to quit.  Tobacco companies are developing products that are claimed to deliver lower levels of toxic substances to the user than do conventional cigarettes.  Tobacco addiction treatment researchers are investigating the possibility that smokers’ cigarette consumption can be reduced (for example, with nicotine gum or patches) and that this may lead to reduced health risk. A major issue is how to determine whether significant reduction in exposure to toxic substances has occurred.  For example, smokers who reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke may smoke them more intensively, thereby extracting more nicotine and other toxic substances from each cigarette, and not significantly reduce their daily intake.  On the other hand, smokers using nicotine patches may inhale less smoke from their cigarettes, thereby reducing their daily exposure.  Therefore, simply counting cigarettes is not a reliable method for estimating exposure to toxic substances.  Methodology for determining intake of specific substances is needed to evaluate these possibilities. Tobacco and tobacco smoke contain numerous toxic substances (for example, about 50 carcinogens have been identified), and measuring exposure to each individually would not be practical.  Our approach is to develop methods for measuring specific toxic substances, or metabolic breakdown products, or other tobacco-derived substances in biologic fluids of smokers, such as blood or urine.  Concentrations of these substances, called “biomarkers” can be used as a measure of exposure.  For example, previous studies of ours, funded by TRDRP, demonstrated that the minor tobacco alkaloids anabasine and anatabine can be used as biomarkers to measure tobacco consumption in persons using nicotine gum or patches.  In collaborative projects with other investigators, concentrations of these alkaloids in urine are being used as an outcome measure to test the efficacy of tobacco cessation programs that use nicotine gum or patches as part of the therapy. A major goal of this proposal is to develop analytical methods for measuring concentrations of biomarkers that will be practical for large-scale clinical studies.  Therefore, we are focusing our efforts on the use of a very sensitive, yet very fast, technique called liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry that is suitable for analysis of large numbers of biological samples.  Studies will be carried out to correlate measures of tobacco smoke exposure with biomarker concentrations in smokers of conventional cigarettes and smokers of new products claimed to be less harmful. Some anticipated applications of the proposed methodology are: (1) monitoring human exposure to toxic substances from different types of cigarettes (such as low nicotine-content cigarettes that have been proposed to be non-addictive); (2) evaluating the health risks of new, potentially less harmful tobacco-based products (such as R. J. Reynolds’ Eclipse or Philip Morris’ Accord, products that heat rather than burn tobacco); (3) evaluating potential harm reduction in tobacco treatment programs (for example, in programs that seek to reduce health risks by reducing cigarette consumption in smokers who are unable to quit, perhaps in conjunction with nicotine maintenance therapy), and (4) assessing the risks of developing tobacco-related diseases in different populations of smokers.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Peyton Jacob,0000-0003-3366-2775,ORCID,https://orcid.org,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0215,award-number,https://doi.org/0.1021/ac060920l,DOI,IsCitedBy,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq478,ROR

These reproductive disorders are of medical importance and have increased in the past several decades. In the United States, as many as 1 in 6 couples may be infertile. Ectopic pregnancy, which is the leading cause of maternal death during the first trimester and which is almost always fatal to the fetus, has quadrupled in the United States since 1970. Our previous work has shown that female reproductive organs (the oviduct and corpus luteum of the ovary) are targets of mainstream (MS) and sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke. The oviduct functions in picking up the oocyte and transport it to the uterus. The corpus luteum develops numerous blood vessels that are essential for distributing the hormones it produces to other organs during pregnancy.  Impairment of oviductal function or blood vessel formation in corpora lutea by smoke may cause infertility, spontaneous abortion, and ectopic pregnancy. We propose to isolate and identify the toxicants in smoke that impair functioning of these organs and to examine the mechanism of action of the toxicants on each organ. The hamster is used as a model for the oviductal studies. Blood vessel development is studied using a chick membrane rich in blood vessels, cultured human blood vessel cells, and hamster corpora lutea.  Isolation and identification of toxicants: A preliminary screen showed that sidestream gas phase smoke (SSG) is more toxic to oviducts and developing blood vessels than any other type of smoke tested. We have used modern biochemical techniques to identify the chemicals present in our SGG smoke solutions.  We are currently screening these chemicals to determine which are toxic in our bioassays. Once the dominant toxicants are identified, we will conduct dose response experiments with individual toxicants to determine which are most detrimental.  We will also determine at what concentration each toxicant produces an effect in intact animals, and we will determine if hamsters exposed to smoke have sufficient levels of each toxicant in their serum to account for malfunctioning of the oviduct and corpus luteum.  Our data will likely lead to identification of molecules in smoke that are highly toxic to reproductive organs but that are not currently recognized as dangerous. Identification of these toxicants may lead to methods for removing them from smoke.  Mechanism of action of SSG toxicants: We showed previously that the least reversible and therefore most damaging mode of action of SSG smoke on the oviduct is to increase adhesion of the oocyte to the surface of the oviduct.  This inhibits oocyte pickup and could in human smokers result in ectopic pregnancy.  One goal is to identify the adhesion molecules that are targets of SSG smoke using a combination of biochemical techniques and assays developed by us for this purpose. Our second goal is to determine how the genes that regulate blood vessel development are affected by SSG smoke. Cultured human blood vessel cells will be exposed to smoke solutions or the isolated toxicants, and DNA analysis techniques will be used to determine which treatments influence gene expression. Smoking machine experiments with hamsters will determine how inhalation of smoke alters processes regulated by the genes that govern blood vessel development in corpora lutea. Results from our studies will be made available for educational purposes and may help prevent women of childbearing age from smoking. People are more likely to stop smoking if they know its effects are imminent (childbearing) rather than remote (death). The techniques we have developed to study reproductive toxicology are needed and may become widely used to study other toxicants. The toxicants in smoke, once identified, could be removed from cigarette smoke, thereby decreasing the toxicity of smoke to women unable to stop smoking during their reproductive years. Our results may also lead to more advanced ways to control the effects of smoke on the reproductive organs. Our DNA data will be posted on the Internet for other investigators to use and will be a valuable resource for any scientist studying the effects of smoke on cells. Finally, our studies will benefit other branches of medicine. Results on the oviduct may apply to any organs having ciliated cells and smooth muscle cells, such as the respiratory system. Our studies on the corpus luteum will contribute to the overall understanding of how smoke affects blood vessel development at other sites, such as in wounds, the lining of the uterus, the placenta, and the embryo/fetus. In general, our studies will benefit the long-term reproductive health of our species.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Prue Talbot,0000-0001-8833-0845,ORCID,https://orcid.org,"University of California, Riverside",https://ror.org/03nawhv43,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0239,award-number,https://doi.org/10.1021/ac8009005,DOI,IsCitedBy,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq479,ROR

SIDS is the second-ranking cause of infant death between one month and one year of age. Impaired control of breathing and arousal responsiveness are believed to be the underlying mechanisms. The incidence of SIDS is known to correlate to maternal smoking, but how it causes SIDS is unknown. About 6 to 7 percent of the U. S. population have sleep apnea, i.e., frequent episodes of limited or no ventilation during sleep. The public health burden attributable to sleep apnea is substantial because sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and other cardiovascular disease, memory problems and lack of sleep leading to job impairment and motor vehicle crashes. Nicotine from cigarette smoking acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain affecting respiratory pattern. The goal of this project is to understand the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying modulation of breathing by nicotine and to identify the pharmacology subtypes of nicotinic receptors mediating the effects. Respiratory rhythm is believed to be generated in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the brainstem in mammals. The concentration of nicotine equivalent to the blood nicotine concentration when a cigarette is smoked will be applied and the nicotine effects on respiratory neurons and neurotransmission in preBötC will be determined. The pre- and/or postsynaptic mechanisms and the receptor subtypes mediating the nicotine effects will be established. The necessity of cholinergic neurotransmission in respiratory rhythm generation will also be examined. Insight into these cellular processes will provide a rational basis for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of SIDS, sleep apnea and respiratory failure during organophosphorus poisoning. Establishing the pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms and identifying the subtypes of nicotinic receptors mediating the cholinergic modulation of breathing will lead to more effective treatments and will help also in the design of drugs more specific to target receptor subtypes with fewer side effects.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Xuesi Shao,,,,"University of California, Los Angeles",https://ror.org/046rm7j60,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0241,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq480,ROR

The disease causes the death of the light sensitive “photoreceptor” cells in a specialized part of the retina called the macula, thus the name macular degeneration.  The macula is a small but very important part of the retina; it is responsible for “fine acuity vision”, the vision one uses when driving, reading, sewing, watching television or any activity requiring fine focus.  Unfortunately, no treatment has been shown to be consistently effective in preventing macular degeneration or reversing the loss of vision caused by the disease. A number of clinical studies have shown that people who smoke cigarettes are two to four times more likely to suffer loss of vision due to macular degeneration than are non-smokers.  The studies detailed in this proposal will begin to determine why, at the most basic cellular and molecular levels, this is true.  The studies will determine experimentally whether tobacco-derived compounds and/or oxidative stress cause abnormalities in the “retinal pigmented epithelial cells” of the eye.  These “RPE” cells are important to the survival and well being of the photoreceptor cells of the retina, and dysfunction in these cells is regarded as a key element in the development of macular degeneration. The goal of the studies is to assess whether, under experimental exposure to tobacco-derived compounds or oxidative conditions, RPE cells exhibit abnormal patterns of production of molecules that (1) form harmful deposits called drusen in the eyes of individuals with macular degeneration or (2) are involved in stimulating the growth of blood vessels in the neovascular or “wet” form of the disease.  These studies will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between smoking and macular degeneration and have the potential to lead to the development of treatments that will reduce visual loss due to this devastating disease.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Lincoln Johnson,,,,"University of California, Santa Barbara",https://ror.org/02t274463,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0250,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq481,ROR

However, the mechanism by which smoking influences gastric cancer development is not known.    Cigarette smoking was recently shown to significantly increase the risk of microsatellite instability (MSI) in a study of sporadic colon cancer.   MSI is a type of genetic change that is believed to promote cancer development by accelerating the accumulation of mutations.  The role of MSI in gastric cancer is not known but it occurs quite frequently in gastric cancers.  Another type of genetic change that is commonly found in colon and gastric cancer patients with MSI tumors is DNA methylation of the MLH1 gene (the MLH1 gene is commonly mutated in individuals with familial colon cancer and have MSI tumors).   In addition, there is suggestive data that DNA methylation levels are higher among current smokers with lung cancer than never smokers with lung cancer.  The relationship between MSI and smoking, DNA methylation and smoking, and the interrelationships between MSI, DNA methylation and smoking in gastric cancers are not known.The objective of this proposed study is to expand a recently completed case-control study of some 700 gastric cancer patients in Los Angeles County by collecting tumor block materials.  This will allow us to determine the prevalence of MSI and DNA methylation in these gastric cancer patients and to link the genetic information to smoking information and other lifestyle factors we have already  collected.    At the completion of this study, we will be able to determine on a population level the frequency of gastric cancers that show high level of MSI, low level of MSI, or no MSI.  Using the information on smoking that has been collected, we will be able to address two questions: One, does cigarette smoking increase the risk of MSI in gastric tumors? Two, does cigarette smoking increase DNA methylation in tissues of gastric cancer patients?   Addressing these questions will offer insights regarding the mechanism of smoking and will improve smoking education and prevention strategies.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Anna Wu,0000-0003-0546-902X,ORCID,https://orcid.org,University of Southern California,https://ror.org/03taz7m60,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0251,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq482,ROR

It is also increasingly clear that the development of tobacco dependence involves the confluence of a number of “vectors of vulnerability.”  Adolescence, a transition period characterized by a number of physiological and psychological changes, represents one important vector. Over 90% of smokers begin smoking before the age of 18, yet little is known about what it is that makes adolescents vulnerable to the initiation of smoking and susceptible to tobacco dependence. Several lines of accumulated evidence indicate the critical role that the initial reward effects of cigarette smoking can play in setting the stage for subsequent nicotine use.  Though much of the previous work on the psychopharmacology of nicotine as well as studies on patterns of tobacco-use have relied upon adult animal and human models, emerging evidence suggests that the neurobiological effects of nicotine differ in the developing brain.  Thus, models of tobacco-use based on adults may not generalize to adolescent populations. The increasing trend in smoking prevalence among adolescents underscores the need for intensifying efforts at delineating how genetic, biological, psychological, social and environmental vectors contribute to smoking behavior patterns and susceptibility to tobacco dependence in youth. Information related to cigarette smoking among adolescents derives almost exclusively from retrospective and anecdotal reports.  Among adults, such reports rarely correspond closely with actual data obtained from self-monitoring of smoking. The major objectives of this study are to: 1) model the influences of situational/contextual and trait factors on the smoking behavior of adolescents and young adults in everyday settings, and 2) determine the contribution of individual differences in hostility/impulsivity to patterns of cigarette smoking and to nicotine-dependence.  For example, there is evidence that nicotine reduces aggressive behavior in animal models, but little is known regarding nicotine’s effects on anger and aggression in humans.  However, no studies have examined whether the putative anger-palliative and attention-enhancing effects of nicotine represent particularly salient mechanisms reinforcing tobacco use among hostile/impulsive individuals.  We propose to identify the stimuli and cues associated with smoking behavior and urges, as well as to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on the subjective and behavioral responses of adolescents and young adults in natural settings, with the goal of identifying distinct patterns of tobacco use and susceptibility.  We also will determine the role of trait and behavioral characteristics (i.e., hostility, impulsivity), gender, and age in the above relationships.   The results of this project will provide important information related to the role of personality and situational factors in the susceptibility to initiation and maintenance of smoking in adolescents and young adults.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Larry Jamner,,,,"University of California, Irvine",https://ror.org/04gyf1771,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0255,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq483,ROR

Hyper-mucus secretion and hyper-mucin production in airway lumen are frequently seen in various airway diseases and tobacco smoke is one of the major contributors to the development of various airway diseases.  The nature of the smoke effect on mucin production is not known.  We have recently demonstrated the expression of MUC5B message in surface airway epithelia of human tissues from patients with various airway diseases, including those are caused by tobacco smoke, such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, etc.  The expression of MUC5B message is normally seen in the mucous cells of the submucosal gland in airway tissues with no obvious inflammation and infection.  In contrast, the expression of MUC5AC message, the other important mucin gene in airway mucin, is strictly seen in the surface epithelia.  Thus, the expression of MUC5B by surface airway epithelium represents a trans-epithelial cell differentiation that is closely related to the symptom pathogenesis.  Our preliminary studies in both primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cultures and in vivo transgenic mice have demonstrated an elevation of MUC5B gene expression by tobacco smoke.  The goal of this application is to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the smoke-induced MUC5B gene expression.  The major hypothesis will be tested is that smoke enhances the transcription of MUC5B gene.  To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed.  Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that cis-elements at the 5'-flanking region of MUC5B gene are responsible for smoke-induced gene expression.  To address this aim, in vivo and in vitro genomic footprintings will be used to identify the location of cis-elements involved in smoke-induced mucin gene expression.  In addition, various promoter-reporter gene chimeric constructs will be prepared and used to elucidate the functional significance of cis-elements in transfection study.  Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that smoke-induced MUC5B expression involves the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.  To address this aim, various mediators for different MAPK pathways will be used to attenuate smoke-induced MUC5B gene expression.  Various dominant negative as well as constitutively active mutants of various MAPK signaling genes will be used to modulate the promoter activity in transfection study.  These approaches will prove important information regarding to the mechanism and signaling pathway involved in smoke-induced MUC5B gene expression.  To address the importance of these findings in vivo, transgenic mice carrying human MUC5B promoter-reporter gene (luciferase) chimeric construct will be used and exposed to smoke (Aim 3).  We will test the hypothesis that both tissue-specific and smoke-inducible gene expression activities are preserved in the 5'-flanking region of human MUC5B gene.

Building upon the literature on bar behavior and the research team's experience research on substance use among workers in different settings including bars, the proposed study will describe patrons', bartenders', and managers' normative understandings of tobacco use, second-hand smoke, and the extent to which California Assembly Bill 13 applies to them.  The overall goal of the proposed study is understanding how and why many stand-alone bars are in noncompliance with California AB13. The proposed research design consists of a two-year study using semi-structured interviews as well as both highly structured and qualitative observations.  A random sample of stand-alone bars (unconnected to restaurants) to study will be drawn from mapped data on alcohol outlets throughout the city.  Because the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Tobacco Free Project recently found only 40% of stand-alone bars to be in compliance with AB13, the final sample of 60 stand-alone bars is expected to include roughly equal numbers of noncompliant bars and compliant bars.  Experienced anthropologists will conduct a total of 80 open-ended interviews with patrons, bartenders, and managers of these randomly selected bars in San Francisco.  Participant observation will take place during four waves of visits in and around these bars.  In order to learn what distinguishes compliant from noncompliant bars, these observational settings will include sites where smoking occurs as well as those where smoking is discouraged. The proposed study focuses on the stand-alone bar as the site of analysis because it represents an environment in which the greatest AB13 compliance problems occur.  The stand-alone bar is the public setting in which the population of patrons and employees is at greatest risk for exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.  This study's findings will produce understandings of the range of bar patron and employee smoking norms and specific rationales for not complying with the ban.  These findings constitute a necessary precursor for large-scale preventive efforts with relevance to this population.  Accordingly, the proposed study should shed light on how to reduce a health problem faced not only by San Francisco bar employees and patrons, but workers and customers in noncompliant bars throughout the state as well.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Roland Moore,0000-0003-1072-2755,ORCID,https://orcid.org,Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation,https://ror.org/01jfr3w16,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0276,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq485,ROR

The most common cause of heart attacks is atherosclerosis, or """"hardening"""" of the arteries.  It is well accepted that individuals that smoke tobacco products have increased risk for developing atherosclerosis. Upon examination of diseased vessels, one sees abnormal growth of blood vessel cells causing narrowing of vessels so as to compromise the flow of blood.  One cell type that is thought to participate in this growth is the vascular smooth muscle cell.  These cells are an important component of the normal blood vessel, providing structural integrity as well as giving the muscular ability to dilate and constrict.  Several risk factors for atherosclerosis such as hypertension and diabetes can cause increased growth of vascular smooth muscle cells.  These diverse risk factors are thought to initiate common signals within the cell to initiate the growth program.  One of these common signals is oxidative stress.  The oxidative stress causes the vascular smooth muscle cell to produce and secrete a variety of proteins that result in the growth of the originating as well as neighboring cells.  Another result of this growth pattern is the deposition of structural proteins that, in the normal blood vessel, aid in strengthening the vessel.  However, produced in excess, these proteins can cause abnormal stiffening of the arteries and veins. Recently our laboratory has discovered that nicotine, one of the active components of tobacco, has similar effects on the vessel wall.  We believe that nicotine may initiate oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells and thereby accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis.  Our preliminary studies indicate that nicotine enhances the production of toxic oxygen-derived free radicals and that antioxidants can inhibit the nicotine-induced growth program.  The project outlined in this proposal will confirm this observation and explore it in greater depth. Moreover, we will test the hypothesis that nicotine can alter the underlying expression pattern of defense molecules within the vascular smooth muscle cell, thereby leaving the cell more vulnerable to injury.  We have developed various models to imitate the effects of nicotine on blood vessel cells and evaluate the effects upon cell growth in highly reproducible assays. It is intriguing to think that there may be a common mechanism by which high blood pressure, high blood sugar (diabetes), and tobacco smoking may cause hardening of the arteries. Exploration into what the pathways are involved in these processes may lead to the design of specific drugs which can target areas which may be more prone to form atherosclerotic plaques.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Philip Tsao,0000-0001-7274-9318,ORCID,https://orcid.org,Palo Alto Veterans Institute For Research,https://ror.org/008e03r59,ROR,https://ror.org,07/01/2001,Issued,n/a,10RT-0298,award-number,,,,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq486,ROR
